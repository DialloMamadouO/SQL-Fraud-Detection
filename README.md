# SQL-Fraud-Detection
In this project, we will apply SQL skills to analyze historical credit card transactions and consumption patterns in order to identify possible fraudulent transactions.
We will strive to accomplish three main tasks:


### Data Modeling:
We created on postgreSQL a database called credit_card_transactions_db, then created five tables.
Using Quick Database Diagrams, we created an entity relationship diagram (ERD) by inspecting the provided CSV files.

### Data Engineering: 
We created a database schema on PostgreSQL and populated our database from the CSV files provided.
Using our database model as a blueprint, we created a database schema for each of our tables and relationships. We specified data types, primary keys and foreign keys.
After creating the database schema, we imported the data from the corresponding CSV files.

### Data Analysis: 
Analyze the data to identify possible fraudulent transactions.
