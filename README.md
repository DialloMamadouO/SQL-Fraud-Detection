# SQL-Fraud-Detection
In this project, we will apply SQL skills to analyze historical credit card transactions and consumption patterns in order to identify possible fraudulent transactions.
We will strive to accomplish three main tasks:


### Data Modeling:
Define a database model to store the credit card transactions data and create a new PostgreSQL database using your model.


### Data Engineering: Create a database schema on PostgreSQL and populate your database from the CSV files provided.


### Data Analysis: Analyze the data to identify possible fraudulent transactions.
