# SQL-Fraud-Detection
In this project, we will apply SQL skills to analyze historical credit card transactions and consumption patterns in order to identify possible fraudulent transactions.
We will strive to accomplish three main tasks:


### Data Modeling:

Using Quick Database Diagrams, we created an entity relationship diagram (ERD) by inspecting the provided CSV files.
We created five tables and defined primary and foreign keys for each table to establish the kind of relationships we need to define among the tables.

### Data Engineering: 
Create a database schema on PostgreSQL and populate your database from the CSV files provided.

### Data Analysis: 
Analyze the data to identify possible fraudulent transactions.
